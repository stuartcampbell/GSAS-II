This version of diffpy.pdffit2 has been modified slightly from the distribution version.

1) The binary file (pdffit2.cp37-win_amd64.pyd, pdffit2.cpython-37m-darwin.so,...) has been relocated to the appropriate GSAS-II binary directory

2) The pdffit2.py file (which simply loads the file above) has been removed

3) The pdffit.py and the __init__.py files have been patched to use different paths.

Note that the diffpy package is not placed directly into the GSASII directory since
GSASIIpath.path2GSAS2 is placed near the beginning of the Python path. If another version of diffpy is in the Python path, we want that to take priority over the one in GSAS-II. Directory .../GSASII/PDFfit2 should be added to the end of sys.path.
