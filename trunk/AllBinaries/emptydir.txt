This directory is intended as a potential home for all GSAS-II binaries, copied over
from the GSAS-II svn server when the bootstrap.py -server switch is
used with this command:

     svn switch https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS/Binaries AllBinaries --ignore-ancestry

This file also keeps this directory from being removed in the
conda packaging process which seems to not include empty directories
