*config_example.py: Configuration options*
-------------------------------------------

This file contains optional configuration options for GSAS-II. The variables
in this file can be copied to file config.py, which is imported if present.
Access these variables using :func:`GSASIIpath.GetConfigValue`, which returns
None if the variable is not set. Note that a config.py file need not
be present, but if in use it will typically be found with the GSAS-II source
directory (GSASIIpath.Path2GSAS2) or a directory for local GSAS-II
modifications (~/.G2local/ or /Documents and Settings/<User>/.G2local/).  
Note that the contents of config.py is usually changed 
using GSASIIctrlGUI.SelectConfigSetting.

When defining new config variables for GSAS-II, define them here with a
default value: use None or a string for strings, or use integers or real
values. Include a doc string after each variable is defined to explain
what it does. Use names ending in _location or _directory for items
that will contain directory names. Use names ending in _exec for executable
files (.exe on windows).

For example::

    test_int = 0
    test_float = 0.0
    test_string = None (or)
    test_string = 'value'
'''

debug = False
'''Set to True to turn on debugging mode. This enables use of IPython on
exceptions and on calls to :func:`GSASIIpath.IPyBreak` or breakpoint(). 
Calls to :func:`GSASIIpath.pdbBreak` will invoke pdb at that location.
%%
If debug is False, calls to :func:`GSASIIpath.IPyBreak`, breakpoint() and
:func:`GSASIIpath.pdbBreak` are ignored.
%%
From inside Spyder, calls to breakpoint() invoke the Spyder debugger, 
independent of the setting of debug. 
%%
Restart GSAS-II for the setting of debug to take effect.

GSAS-II is installed, use this::

    Tutorial_location = GSASIIpath.path2GSAS2

As another example, to use ~/.G2tutorials do this::

    Tutorial_location = '~/.G2tutorials'

Note that os.path.expanduser is run on Tutorial_location before it is used.
Also note that GSASIIpath is imported inside config.py; other imports should be
avoided.
'''

Save_paths=False

Multiprocessing_cores = 0
''' Specifies the number of cores to use when performing multicore computing. A number less
than zero causes the recommended number of cores [using multiprocessing.cpu_count()/2]
