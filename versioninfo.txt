# information to be shown to users about new GSAS-II versions (also
# update GSASIIctrlGUI.updateNoticeDict). Lines starting with "#" are
# comments.
# Each version is tagged with a version number and a colon. All subsequent text
# is the notice for that version with one or more blank lines between.

# 5000: This is text for version 5000. It spans several lines. 
#   Note that indents are ignored, but 2 percent signs create a newline. %%%%This
#  starts on a new line with a blank after the previous.

# 1234: This is text for version 1234. The second colon here (:) is ignored. 

4918: With this version of GSAS-II, the profile functions have been changed to account for possible variation in the powder 
pattern step size across the scan. This will likely change the histogram scale factor (see Sample Parameters), peak
intensities (see Peak List) and background peak intensities (see Background). For Constant Wavelength data, they will change 
by a factor related to the pattern step size, e.g. for 11BM data with a step size of 0.001 deg 2-theta the new scale factor will be 
~0.1 times the old one. If you choose to repeat the refinement for this project, you may need to be sure that parameters affecting 
peak shape are turned off for the initial refinement. It should converge quickly to the new scale factor.
%%For TOF data there may be similar changes to the scale factor && peak intensities as noted above. Significant improvement in profile 
residuals have been observed in some cases with these new functions.
This change is of no consequence for single crystal, small angle or reflectometry data in GSAS-II.
